# Proposal: Enhance UI and AI Features

## Goal
Transform Stash into a premium, visually engaging "Stash" application by adopting the "reference-demo" aesthetic and integrating AI-powered features (simulated for now).

## Motivation
The current UI is basic. The "reference-demo" provides a modern, high-quality design (cards, rich colors, emojis) and compelling features (AI summaries, chat) that align with the goal of a personal "digital loot box".

## Scope
1.  **UI Overhaul**: Reimplement the main list and detail views using the "Stash" design language (SwiftUI).
2.  **Data Model**: Extend `AssetItem` to support AI summaries, tags, and cover art (emoji/color).
3.  **AI Integration**: Implement the "Ask Gemini" chat UI and "Refine Summary" flow (simulated logic initially, preparing for real API).
